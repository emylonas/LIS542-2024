Salisbury State College
Salisbury, Maryland
The center section of Holloway Hall at-Salisbury State College, including the noble bell tower atop which one can scan the historical city of Salisbury in its entirety, was completed in 1929. Students and townspeople alike are enriched by lyrical sounds emanating from the tower's Carillon of Bells, presented to the College by the Alumni Association on November 5, 1973. </imageDescriptor>

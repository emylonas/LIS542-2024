Salisbury State College<break/>
Salisbury, Maryland<break/>
The center section of Holloway Hall at Salisbury State 
College, including the noble bell tower atop which one can 
scan the historical city of Salisbury in its entirety, was 
completed in 1929. Students and townspeople alike are 
enriched by lyrical sounds emanating from the tower's 
Carillon of Bells, presented to the College by the Alumni 
Association on November 5, 1973.</contextualinfo> <date when="08-05">Aug. 5</date>

                <lb/><p><!-- My Dear Brother
                                I was very much gratified
indeed by the reception of the kind favour you
5sent by Mr Lennie &[ ]s I am just about
to cross the boundary of comparative civilizat
-ion in order to visit the Interior I should be
sorry did I not give you a word in
passing by way of acknowledgment.
10An answer it cannot be for I have
unfortunately left yours behind at Kuru
-man But I hope you will receive it such
as it is with forbearance
I am most happy to hear the heart
15enlivening accounts of the state of your
missions among the Bassoutos, you
have been very highly favoured, May the
Lord grant that you be blessed still
more & that you may not only become
20the benefactors of the people among
whom you at present are But that
by means of them you may become
blessings to many beyond you in the
Interior. Many being raised up by your
25[      ] instrumentality to spread the knowledge

I expect to return (D[ ]) in about 4 months. If you kindly write
so that I receive it on my return & I shall be glad,     My friend you
try & decipher putting in words awanting try & leaving out those which ought
                                                                                                                            never to have
30                                                                                                                            been in
                                                                                                                                  D.L.--></p>

                <!-- of the everlasting gospel.     Mrs L has no
doubt given you an account of the state
of affairs here & at K.    The aspect of
The\Mission is not so wanting as one might
5expect   But still the change which has been
affected in a portion of this people is very
great indeed.     It is not such as would
strike a visitor from Europe or the Colony
with any thing but disapointment, particular[  ]
10if he had heard the accounts of it which
the good Christians in England by usually
do   But after one sees the depths from
which they have been elevated exemplified
in the Interior tribes there is considerable
15cause for Thanksgiving     By the way when
I think of the degradation of these people I shall
be glad if you wil let me know if you
believe they are really so very far sunk
as has been represented, I heard Mr Moffat
20say in England that the Bechuanas had
really no conscience until it was formed
by the missionaries, Now although the
statement excited my risible faculties a
little at the time   thinking it was only a
25poetical figure expressive of the wonderful
creative powers of us Sentelings   The same
statement nearly appearing in his book -->

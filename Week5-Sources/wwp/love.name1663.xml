Which Letters are not Printed by true and exact Copies,
<lb/>having in them both more and le≈øs than they ≈øhould have. Now to prevent the like incon¬≠
<lb/>venience for the future, the≈øe Letters and Petitions are here publi≈øhed. The publi≈øhing of
<lb/>which, will (I hope) give no offence; I am ≈øure can, give no ju≈øt offence to any: and if
<lb/>any ≈øhall take offence thereat, certain I am, they'll take that which is not given them;
<lb/>and that they cannot do, unle≈øs they will be injurious both to them≈øelves and others. But whether offended,
<lb/>or not offended, I am not, need not be ≈øollicitous; the rather, for that I can truly ≈øay, it is at as great a distance
<lb/>from any intention in the lea≈øt to give offence, as 'tis from my apprehen≈øion to imagine that the publi≈øhing of the≈øe
<lb/>≈øhould give ju≈øt offence to any.</p>
        <p>The Petitions are ≈øome of tho≈øe (and tho≈øe very affectionate ones) which <persName ref="p:mlove.uko">Mi≈øtris 
<hi rend="slant(upright)">Love</hi></persName> pre≈øented to the 
<lb/><orgName>Parliament</orgName>, in the behalf of that ble≈ø≈øed Saint and Mini≈øter of Chri≈øt, 
her dear Husband <persName ref="p:clove.efe">Ma≈øter <hi rend="slant(upright)">Love</hi></persName>; and
<lb/>that either for the taking off the ≈øentence of death, which he then lay under, and ≈øo wholly to remit it; or if not
<lb/>that, for his bani≈øhment; and if neither of them, for his reprieve till her delivery (≈øhe being then big with
<lb/>child) that ≈øo ≈øhe might with greater hope and probability of ≈øafety, both to her ≈øelf and unborn babe, under¬≠
<lb/>go ≈øo ≈øad and ≈øore an affliction.</p>
        <p>The Letters are, ≈øome from <persName ref="p:mlove.uko">Mi≈øtris <hi rend="slant(upright)">Love</hi></persName> to her husband, 
which again occa≈øioned others from him to her.
<lb/>Now <persName ref="p:clove.efe">Ma≈øter <hi rend="slant(upright)">Love</hi></persName> having his wife frequently with him in pri≈øon, 
after his tryall was ordered, had thereby
<lb/>opportunity, as to open his very heart unto her, in reference to his own e≈øtate and condition, and the apprehen¬≠
<lb/>≈øions which he had, both of it, and of his ≈øufferings, (which accordingly he did, to her exceeding great ≈øati≈ø¬≠
<lb/>faction and comfort) ≈øo al≈øo to speak that to her, that might be, and that afterwards did prove to be, a great
<lb/>means of her ≈øupport, under tho≈øe trying and pre≈ø≈øing afflictions with which ≈øhe did encounter: and upon that
<lb/>account, did not, and indeed did not need to write unto her ≈øo fully and largly, as otherwi≈øe he would have
<lb/>done: And yet the≈øe brief Notes of his (for ≈øo they would rather be called than Letters) which were not by
<lb/>him intended to be publi≈øhed, do clearly and abundantly evidence, what, and how indeared his affections
<lb/>were both to his wife and children: and will (I doubt not) be an an≈øwer ≈øufficient to that charge of 
unna<unclear reason="obscured">t</unclear>u¬≠
<lb/>ralne≈øs that is in print again≈øt him: Though I may ≈øay, as to tho≈øe that knew him, or have but the lea≈øt de¬≠
<lb/>gree of that charity that is called common, remaining in them; that unchri≈øtian charge, and mo≈øt malicious
<lb/>≈ølander (invented by the father of lyes him≈øelf, with many more of the ≈øame Satanical production) of that
<lb/>foul-mouth'd, fal≈øe-mouth'd Animadverter and impudent Detractour, needs no an≈øwer. And notwith≈øtand¬≠
<lb/>ing all that hath been ≈øaid by that <mcr rend="slant(upright)">Doctor of the Chair of Scorners</mcr>, 
(who≈øe de≈øign ≈øeems to be to fright
<lb/>men more with the rabble of his words, than with the rea≈øon of them; the former being not more formidable,
<lb/>than the latter feeble,) <persName ref="p:clove.efe">Ma≈øter <hi rend="slant(upright)">Love</hi></persName>, though dead, yet is not dead; for 
<emph rend="case(smallcaps)slant(upright)">His Good Name Lives</emph>,
<lb/>and the remembrance of it to the godly, is, and will never cea≈øe to be, even to perpetual generations, as a box
<lb/>of mo≈øt precious and costly syntment, broken or poured forth, the plea≈øant ≈øavour and ≈øweet perfume wherof,
<lb/>spreads it ≈øelf every way, even to the ≈øcattering and overcoming of all that noi≈øome and un≈øavoury breath of
<lb/>reproach and calumny, that by the ≈øons, yea, and daughters too, of ≈ølander, with great indeavour would be, but
<lb/>by no means what≈øoever can be cast upon it, and to the refre≈øh<choice><sic>‚ê£</sic><corr>i</corr></choice>ng and reviving of every one 
who is within the
<lb/>reach of its fragrant and perfuming odour.</p>
        <p>The other Letters, are, one from <persName ref="p:jaquel.olf"><choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Master</expan></choice><hi rend="slant(upright)">Jaquel</hi></persName> to

<lb/>The re≈øt, from ≈øeveral of tho≈øe Mini≈øters, who (as to impri≈øonment) were his fellow-≈øufferers; which Letters
<lb/>do ≈øufficiently demon≈øtrate, what their thoughts and apprehen≈øions were of <persName ref="p:clove.efe"><choice><abbr>M.</abbr><expan>Master</expan></choice><hi rend="slant(upright)">Loves</hi></persName> ≈øufferings, and do all con¬≠

          <item>5. Pore not on the comforts thou wante≈øt, but on the mercies thou ha≈øt.</item>
          <item>6. Look rather at Gods ends in afflicting, than at the mea≈øure and degree 
of thy afflictions.</item>
          <item>7. Labour to clear up thy evidences for heaven, when God takes from thee the comforts of earth,
<lb/>that as thy ≈øufferings do abound, ≈øo thy con≈øolations in Chri≈øt 
may abound much more, <bibl source="b:IT50011" xml:id="TR00482_b068"><regMe>2 <title xml:id="TR00482_t066">Cor.</title> 1.4.</regMe></bibl></item>
          <item>8. Though it is good to maintain a holy jealou≈øie of the deceitfulne≈øs of thy heart, yet it is evill for
<lb/>thee to cheri≈øh fears and doubts, about the truth of thy graces; If ever I had confidence touching the
<lb/>grace of another, I have confidence of grace in thee; I can ≈øay of thee as <persName ref="p:peter.nex">Peter</persName> 
did of <persName ref="p:silvanus.nut">Silvanus</persName>, I am
<lb/>per≈øwaded that this is the grace of God wherein thou ≈øtande≈øt,

<lb/>fore do≈øt thou doubt, who≈øe heart hath been upright, who≈øe walkings have been holy,
 <hi rend="slant(italic)">&amp;c.</hi> I could
<lb/>venture my ≈øoul in thy ≈øouls ≈øtead, ≈øuch a confidence 
have I of thee.</item>
          <item>9. When thou finde≈øt thy heart ≈øecure, pre≈øumptuous and proud, then pore upon corruption,
<lb/>more than upon grace; but when thou finde≈øt thy heart doubting and unbelieving, then look on thy
<lb/>graces, not on thy infirmities.</item>
          <item>10. Study the covenant of grace and merits of Chri≈øt, 
and then be troubled if thou can≈øt. Thou
<lb/>art intere≈øted in ≈øuch a covenant that accepts purpo≈øes for performances, de≈øires for deeds, ≈øincerity
<lb/>for perfection, the righteou≈øne≈øs of another, <hi rend="slant(italic)">viz.</hi> that of 
<persName rend="slant(upright)" ref="p:jchrist.hjn">Je≈øus Chri≈øt</persName>, as if it were thine own. Oh my
<lb/>Love! re≈øt, re≈øt then in the love of God, in the bo≈øome of 
Chri≈øt.</item>
          <item>11. Swallow up thy will in the will of God; it is a bitter cup we are to drink, 
but it is the cup our
<lb/>Father hath put into our hands. When <persName ref="p:paul.pbe">Paul</persName> was to go to ≈øuffer at 
<placeName rend="slant(italic)">Jeru≈øalem</placeName>, the <name>Chri≈øtians</name> could ≈øay,
            <lb/><quote source="b:IT50023" xml:id="TR00482_q018">The will of the Lord be done</quote>; Oh, ≈øay thou, when I go to <placeName>Tower-hill</placeName>, The will of the Lord be
<lb/>done.</item>
          <item>12. Rejoyce in my joy; to mourn for me inordinately, argues that either thou envie≈øt, or ≈øu≈øpecte≈øt
<lb/>my happine≈øs. The joy of the Lord is my ≈øtrength, oh let it be thine al≈øo. Dear wife, farewell; I will
<lb/>call thee wife no more, I ≈øhall ≈øee thy face no more: yet I am not much troubled, for now I am going
<lb/>to meet the Bridegroome the Lord <persName rend="slant(upright)" ref="p:jchrist.hjn">Je≈øus Chri≈øt</persName>,
 to whom I ≈øhall be eternally marryed.</item>

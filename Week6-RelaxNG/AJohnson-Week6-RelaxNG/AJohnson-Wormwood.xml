After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <place>Modesto</place> paper. <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up <quote>"scripture"</quote>

            Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name>Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name>Mamma</name>, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M</name>. got school journal and circular from supt. <name>McClure</name>.

Argued about <quote>"Back woodsers"</quote> and <quote>"Mountain heathens"</quote>. They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name>Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over

Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name>Mr. Essex,</name> the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says <quote>"Dollie is - is - is, all right."</quote> <quote>"She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quote> <name>Roy, </name><name>Nellie</name> and I are <quote>"Smart alecks."</quote> I went to bed at seven o clock.

            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.

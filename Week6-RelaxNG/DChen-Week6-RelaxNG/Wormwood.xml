            <p>Got up early. Pretty day, –thawed considerably. Had full school. Good lessons.
                    After supper had discussion on "Negro" and "Indian" question. Laughed about
                <name>Dollie</name> and me goin' (Gowin). <name>Roy</name> ate an onion, and I went in
                    the other room and drew map of Italy. Beautiful night, not very cold. Went to
                    bed early. I rode home from school, <name>Jennie Dyer</name> and I stood up.</p>

                <p>Pretty day. Had good school. <name>Lou</name> went home at last recess. They
                    laughed about "Scratch" bringing <name>Rose</name> home. A. class drew map of
                    Italy, on board. In B. Geog. I asked how high is the highest peak in</p>

                <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon
                        <name>Irwin</name> and <name>Roy</name> tried to see who could act the
                        <quotation>"biggest monkey."</quotation> Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped
                    rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name>Lou</name> and <name>Lillie</name> fixed
                    minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <name>Lillie's</name> watch back
                    with mine. – <name>Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry.
                        <name>Nellie</name> and <name>Mary</name> went to church. <name>J</name>
                    called us <quotation>"Back woodsers"</quotation> I replied, that I would rather
                    be</p>
    
            <pb n="p03"/>
                <p>a <quotation>"backwoodser"</quotation> than a <quotation>"heathen".</quotation>
                    We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name>Mr.
                        Strate's</name>. Had music. Laughed at <name>Joe</name> and <name>Charlie</name> about going to <quotation>"Hunt"('s)</quotation>
                        <name>Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately
                    seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all <quotation>"Young."</quotation>
                    When we started home it was raining. <name>John</name> <name>Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture.
                    (<name>Dollie</name> thought we were going to China.) <name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about
                    Kentuckians. <name>Peek's</name> brought <name>Mary</name> and <name>Nellie</name> home. <name>John Whitehouse</name> was converted.
                    (<name>John W.</name> came to school this evening for <name>Lou</name> and <name>Lillie.</name></p>

                <date when="1896-01-31">January 31st. Friday.</date>
            <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name>Irwin</name>, <name>Walter</name>, <name>Charlie</name>, <name>Roy</name> + <name>John</name> went down
                the road and came back after school had called. <name>Roy</name> and <name>John</name> tried themselves.
                    –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After
                    school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, <dialogue>I asked if I had made
                    any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired.</dialogue>
                The reply, <dialogue>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</dialogue> A I came
                    across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the
                    rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not
                    read. After supper he brought up "scripture </p>
  
            <pb n="p05"/>
                <p> argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us
                    his explanation. Calls us <quotation>"backwoodsers."</quotation> We went to bed early. <name>Lillie</name> did not
                    come to school.</p> 
            
            
            <date when="1896-02-01">February 1st. Saturday </date>
            
            
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be
                at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most
                of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to
                be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to Modesto. <name>Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name>
                    baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that
                    I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not
                hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M.</name> got
                school journal and circular from <name>supt. McClure.</name> </p>

            <pb n="p06"/>
                <p> told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils
                    around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues.,
                    following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about <quotation>"Back woodsers"</quotation>
                    and <quotation>"Mountain heathens"</quotation>. They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they
                    were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain
                    remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went
                    to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name>Rhoads</name>
                    preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home
                    about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us
                    about going over </p>

            <pb n="p07"/>
            <p>to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name>Dollie</name> to take her part in the
                dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold
                    two)</p> 
            
            <date when="1896-02-02">February 2nd. Sunday. </date>
            
            <p>Rainy and dark. <name>Jess</name> went away. <name>Charie
                    Crawford</name> came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in
                the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".)<!-- assuming these are story names and not quotations--> <name>Roy</name> and
                I took down items; and <name>Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up
                and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name>Roy</name> but <name>Charlie</name> got it. They went in
                    little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the
                    milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put
                    the hogs in the</p>

            <p>lot. <name>Dolly</name> went to put <name>Joe's</name> hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had
                    dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right.
                <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name>Mr. Essex</name>, the best
                    looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says<quotation>
                    "Dollie is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quotation>
                <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are <quotation>"Smart alecks."</quotation> I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed,
                    rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with
                    snow and sleet. </p> 
            
            <date when="1896-02-03">February 3rd. Monday. </date>
            
            
            <p>Two or three inches of snow and
                    still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but
                    thawed more than it snowed</p>

            <pb n="p09"/>
            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk
                    about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the
                    girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. <dialogue>(If you'll come over after school
                        is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.)</dialogue> I was tired all day: about sick. After
                    supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had
                    no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed
                    suicide.</p>

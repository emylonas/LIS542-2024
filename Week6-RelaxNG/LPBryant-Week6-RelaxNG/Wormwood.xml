           <p> Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <name role="student">Irwin</name> and <name role="student">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name role="student">Lou</name> and <name role="student">Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <name role="student">Lillie's</name> watch back with mine. – <name role="student">Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name role="student">Nellie</name> and <name role="student">Mary</name> went to church. <name role="undetermined">J</name> called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that I would rather be</p>

            <p>a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name role="undetermined">Mr. Strate's</name>. Had music. Laughed at <name role="undetermined">Joe</name> and <name role="student">Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name role="student">Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name role="undetermined">John</name> <name role="student">Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture. (<name role="undetermined">Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place>China</place>.) <name role="undetermined">Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <name role="undetermined">Peek's</name> brought <name role="student">Mary</name> and <name role="student">Nellie</name> home. <name role="undetermined">John Whitehouse</name> was converted.

            <date when="1895-01-31">January 31st. Friday.</date>
            <p> Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name role="student">Irwin</name>, <name role="student">Walter</name>, <name role="student">Charlie</name>, <name role="student">Roy</name> + <name role="student">John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name role="student">Roy</name> and <name role="student">John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <place>Modesto</place> paper. <name role="student">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>

            <p>argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <name role="student">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p>

            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name role="student">Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name role="student">Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name role="student">Roy</name> cut wood. <name role="student">Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name role="student">Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name role="undetermined">Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name role="undetermined">Mamma</name>, <name role="undetermined">Ida</name> and <name role="undetermined">Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from supt. <name role="superintendent">McClure</name>.</p>

           <p>told about hauling one ([<name role="student">Jennie</name>]) of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name role="undetermined">Joe</name> came home with <name role="student">Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name role="undetermined">Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name role="undetermined">Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name role="undetermined">Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name role="undetermined">Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name role="religious official">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name role="religious official">King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name role="student">Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over</p>

           <p>to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name role="student">Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name role="student">Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>

            <p>Rainy and dark. <name role="student">Jess</name> went away. <name role="student">Charie Crawford</name> came. I read story of <title sourcetype="book">"Howard and his Teacher"</title>. Laughed about <title sourcetype="book">"Love in the Kitchen"</title>; also <title sourcetype="book">"Love in the Front-room."</title> ("<quote>I'd get it and keep it</quote>".) <name role="student">Roy</name> and I took down items; and <name role="undetermined">Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name role="student">Roy</name> but <name role="student">Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name role="student">Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the</p>

Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name role="student">Jess</name> says <name role="undetermined">Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name role="undetermined">Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name role="student">Jess</name> says <quote>"Dollie is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quote> Roy, Nellie and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet. </p>
            <date when="1895-02-03">February 3rd.    Monday.</date>
            <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>

            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name role="undertermined">Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name role="student">Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

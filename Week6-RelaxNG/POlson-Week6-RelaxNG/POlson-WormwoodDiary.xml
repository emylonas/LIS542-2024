            <change when="2024-05-01" who="">Added markup in accordance with PO's edited diary
                schema. Removed existing markup such as 'PAGE N' to avoid repetition. Altered schema
                to make @role for name optional, as many names here are not clear in their role.
                added missing transcription for entry on 29 jan. changed 'place' element to allow name elements inside it, for denoting that "person x's" is a place, but "person x" is also a name. allowed 'cite' to contain names. allowed p to contain dates called ReferencedDates </change>

            <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded
            in afternoon. At noon <name role="student">Irwin</name> and <name role="student">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey."
                Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name role="student">Lou</name> and <name role="student">Lillie</name> fixed

            a "backwoodser" than a
            "heathen". We went down to the <place>school house</place>. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <place><name>Mr.
            Strate</name>'s</place>. Had music. Laughed at <name>Joe</name> and <name>Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name>Charlie</name> has
            concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the
            <place>creek</place>. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was
            raining. <name>John</name> <name>Dollie</name> and I came across the <place>pasture</place>. (<name>Dollie</name> thought we were going to
            <place>China</place>.) <name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <name>Peek</name>'s brought <name>Mary</name> and

            Dark and rainy.

            after school had called. <name role="student">Roy</name> and <name role="student">John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my
            actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in
            register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to
            cause such actions as had transpired. <quote><cite>The reply,</cite><quotation> "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a
            notion to be mean."</quotation></quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the
            water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he
            could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            argument; read two chapters
            from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us
            "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <name role="student">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p>

            <date when="1896-02-01">February 1st. Saturday</date> 
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to
            the <place>Local Institute</place>. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise.
            Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan
                skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name role="student">Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken
            for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name abbr="true">Jess</name> said it was
            the first time he ever saw me not hungry) Ed came in the evening. He got letters from
                <name>Mamma</name>, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M</name>. got school journal and circular from supt. <name role="superintendent">McClure</name>. 
            <pb n="p06"/>
            told about hauling one <marginalia location="above">Jermin</marginalia> of my pupils around in the
            big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on <referencedDate when="1986-02-04">Tues</referencedDate>., following the wagon-ride.
            <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said
            <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to <place>town</place>. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me
            take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave
            us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to <place>church</place> with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through
            the fields. <name>Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting.
                Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name role="student">Lillie</name> came to tell
            us about going over 
            <pb n="p07"/>
            to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name>Dollie</name> to
            take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to
            hold <measure count="2" countedEntity="people">two</measure>) </p>

            <p>Rainy and dark. <name>Jess</name> went away. <name>Charie Crawford</name>
            came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen";
            also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <name>Roy</name> and I took down items;
            and <name>Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room.
            threw the book to <name>Roy</name> but <name>Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we
            would not let them alone: they went out by the <place>milk house</place> and read, then gave us the
            book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            to put <name>Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether
            pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good
            looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name>Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for

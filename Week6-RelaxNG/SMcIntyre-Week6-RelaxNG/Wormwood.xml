            <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <name role="student">Irwin</name> and <name role="student">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name role="student">Lou</name> and <name role="student">Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned Lillie's watch back with mine. – <name>Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name>Nellie</name> and <name>Mary</name> went to church. <name>J</name> called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that I would rather be</p>

            <p>a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name>Mr. Strate's</name>. Had music. Laughed at <name role="acquaintance">Joe</name> and <name role="acquaintance">Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name role="acquaintance">Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name>John Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture. (<name>Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place type="country">China</place>.) <name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. Peek's brought <name>Mary</name> and <name>Nellie</name> home. <name>John Whitehouse</name> was converted. (<name>John W.</name> came to school this evening for <name>Lou</name> and <name>Lillie</name>.</p>

Had twenty pupils. <name>Irwin</name>, <name>Walter</name>, <name>Charlie</name>, <name>Roy</name> + <name>John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name>Roy</name> and <name>John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>

            <p>argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us <quote>"backwoodsers."</quote> We went to bed early. <name>Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p>
            <date when="1895-02-01">February 1st. Saturday</date>
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name>Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M</name>. got school journal and circular from supt. <name>McClure</name>.</p>

            <p>told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above  -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place type="city">Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name role="preacher">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over</p>

            <p>to <place type="city"></place>Scottsville to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name>Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two) </p>

            <p>Rainy and dark. <name>Jess</name> went away. <name>Charie Crawford</name> came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <name>Roy</name> and I took down items; and <name>Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name>Roy</name> but <name>Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the</p>

Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place type="State">Illinois</place>. <name>Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place type="state">Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says "<name>Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right." <quote>"She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quote> <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are <quote>"Smart alecks."</quote> I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet. </p>
            <date when="1895-02-03">February 3rd.    Monday.</date>
            <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>

            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

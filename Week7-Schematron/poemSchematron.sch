        6. This one is advanced! Write a rule to check that the lines in any sonnet have a @rhyme attribute
         Ex: <l n="0001" rhyme="a"><lb/>poetic line</l> 
         The limerick shouldn't have @rhyme attributes. HINT: think about XPath axes.

      7. This one is also advanced! Write a rule to check that each line in a poem is immediately followed by an lb element 
      You can add a second rule inside pattern 1 above, which checks that there is an <lb> inside each <l>element.

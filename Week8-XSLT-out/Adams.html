            <p><span class="name">Archibald Bullock</span> and <span class="name">John Houstoun</span> Esquires, and the <span class="name">Revd. Dr. Zubly</span>, appear as Delegates from <span class="place">Georgia</span>.</p>
            
            <p><span class="name">Dr. Zubly</span> is a Native of <span class="place">Switzerland</span>, and a Clergyman of the Independent <span class="original">Perswasion</span><span class="modern">Persuasion</span>, settled in a <span class="place">Parish in Georgia</span>. He speaks, as it is reported, Several Languages, English, Dutch, French, Latin <span class="original">&amp;c</span><span class="modern">et cetera</span>. -- is reported to be a learned Man. He is a Man of a warm and zealous Spirit. It is said that he possesses considerable Property.</p>
            
            <p><span class="name">Houstoun</span> is a young Gentleman, by Profession a Lawyer, educated under a Gentleman of Eminence in <span class="place">South Carolina</span>. He seems to be sensible and spirited, but rather inexperienced.</p>
            
            <p><span class="name">Bullock</span> is cloathed in American Manufacture.</p>
            
            <p><span class="name">Thomas Nelson</span> Esquire, <span class="name">George Wythe</span> Esqr., and <span class="name">Francis Lightfoot Lee </span>Esq. appeared as Delegates from <span class="place">Virginia</span>.</p>
            
            <p><span class="name">Nelson</span> is a fat Man, like the late <span class="name">Coll. Lee</span> of <span class="place">Marblehead</span>. He is a Speaker, and alert and lively, for his Weight.
<span class="name">Wythe</span> is a Lawyer, it is said of the first Eminence.
<span class="name">Lee</span> is a Brother of <span class="name">Dr. Arthur</span>, the late Sheriff of London, and our old Friend <span class="name">Richard Henry</span>, sensible, and patriotic, as the rest of the Family.</p>

            <p>Deane says, that two Persons, of the Name of De Witt of Dutch Extraction, one in Norwich the other in Windham, have made Salt Petre with Success -- and propose to make a great deal. That there is a Mine of Lead at Middletown, which will afford a great Quantity. That Works are preparing to smelt and refine it, which will go in a fortnight. There is a Mine at Northampton, which <span class="name">Mr. W. Bowdoin</span> spent much Money in working, with much Effect, tho little Profit.</p>
            
            <p><span class="name">Langdon</span> and <span class="name">Bartlett</span> came in this Evening, from <span class="place">Portsmouth</span>. 400 Men are building a Fort on Pierce's Island to defend the Town vs. Ships of War.</p>
            
<p>Upon recollecting the Debates of this Day in Congress, there appears to me a remarkable Want of judgment in some of our Members. <span class="name">Chace</span> is violent and boisterous, asking his Pardon. He is tedious upon frivolous Points. So is <span class="name">E. Rutledge</span>. Much precious Time is indiscreetly expended. Points of little Consequence are started, and debated [with] warmth. <span class="name">Rutledge</span> is a very uncouth, and ungracefull Speaker. He shruggs his Shoulders, distorts his Body, nods and wriggles with his Head, and looks about  [page00]  with his Eyes, from side to side, and Speaks thro his Nose, as the Yankees Sing. His Brother <span class="name">John</span> dodges his Head too, rather disagreably, and both of them Spout out their Language in a rough and rapid Torrent, but without much Force or Effect.</p>
            
            <p>Dyer is long winded and roundabout -- obscure and cloudy.  Very talkative and very tedious, yet an honest, worthy Man, means and judges well.</p>
            
            <p>Sherman's Air is the Reverse of Grace. There cannot be a more striking Contrast to beautifull Action, than the Motions of his Hands. Generally, he stands upright with his Hands before him. The fingers of his left Hand clenched into a Fist, and the Wrist of it, grasped with his right. But he has a clear Head and sound judgment. But when he moves a Hand, in any thing like Action, Hogarths Genuis could not have invented a Motion more opposite to grace. It is Stiffness, and Aukwardness itself. Rigid as Starched Linen or Buckram. Aukward as a junior Batchelor, or a Sophomore.</p>
            
            <p>Mr. Dickinsons Air, <span class="original">Gate</span><span class="modern">gait</span>, and Action are not much more elegant.</p>

    <h2>1775 SEPT. 16. SATURDAY</h2>.
    
    <p>Walking to the Statehouse this Morning, I met <span class="name">Mr. Dickinson</span>, on Foot in Chesnut Street. We met, and passed near enough to touch Elbows. He passed without moving his Hat, or Head or Hand. I bowed and pulled off my Hat. He passed hautily by. The Cause of his Offence, is the Letter no doubt which Gage has printed in Drapers Paper.</p>

<p>I shall for the future pass him, in the same manner. But I was determined to make my Bow, that I might know his Temper.</p>

<p>We are not to be upon speaking Terms, nor bowing Terms, for the time to come.</p>

<p>This Evening had Conversation with <span class="name">Mr. Bullock</span> of <span class="place">Georgia</span>. -- I asked him, whether <span class="place">Georgia</span> had a Charter? What was the Extent of the Province? What was their Constitution? How justice was ad ministered? Who was Chancellor, who Ordinary? and who judges?</p>

<p>He says they have County Courts for the Tryal of civil Causes under 8. -- and a <span class="original">C.</span><span class="modern">Chief</span> Justice, appointed from Home and 3 other judges appointed by the Governor, for the decision of all other Causes civil and criminal, at Savanna. That the Governor alone is both Chancellor and Ordinary.</p>

     [page05] 

<p><span class="name">Parson Gordon</span> of <span class="place">Roxbury</span>, spent the Evening here. -- I fear his indiscreet Prate will do harm in this City. He is an eternal Talker, and somewhat vain, and not accurate nor judicious. Very zealous in the Cause, and a well meaning Man, but incautious, and not sufficiently tender of the Character of our Province, upon which at this Time much depends. Fond of being thought a Man of Influence, at Head Quarters, and with our Council and House, and with the general Officers of the Army, and also with Gentlemen in this City, and other Colonies. -- He is a good Man, but wants a Guide.</p></div>
        
<div><h2>1775 SEPTR. 17TH. SUNDAY.</h2>
    
<p><span class="name">Mr. Smith</span>, <span class="name">Mr. Imlay </span>and <span class="name">Mr. Hanson</span>, breakfasted with us. <span class="name">Smith</span> is an Englishman,Imlay and Hanson N. Yorkers.
    Heard <span class="original">Sprout</span><span class="modern">Sproat</span>, on 3 Tit. 5. Not by Works of Righteousness, which We have done, but according to his Mercy he saved us, through the Washing of Regeneration and the Renewing of the holy Ghost.</p>
    
<p>There is a great deal of Simplicity and Innocence in this worthy Man, but very little Elegance or Ingenuity. -- In Prayer, he hangs his Head in an Angle of 45 over his right Shoulder. In Sermon, which is delivered without Notes, he throws himself into 
     [page06]  a Variety of indecent Postures. Bends his Body, Points his Fingers, and throws about his Arms, without any Rule or Meaning at all. He is totally destitute of the Genius and Eloquence of <span class="original">Duffil</span><span class="modern">Duffield</span>, has no Imagination, No Passions, no Wit, <span class="del">and very little</span> no Taste and very little Learning, but a great deal of Goodness of Heart.</p></div>

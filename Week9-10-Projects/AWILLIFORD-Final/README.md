This is an encoded file based on the diary entries of Emma Wormwood, a school teacher from 1896. I have added elements such as weather, class size, media type, and content warnings.
I have also added attributes to existing elements, such as notes, which now have locations so that marginalia can be properly noted. 
The HTML and CSS have been augmented to add colors to elements and clean up the page numbers. 

If you have any questions, please feel free to email me at w.alex@wustl.edu. Thanks!

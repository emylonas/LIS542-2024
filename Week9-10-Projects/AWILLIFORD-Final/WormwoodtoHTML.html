After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <span class="quote"><em>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</em></span> A I came across <span class="place">the bridge</span> I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks.

            to <span class="place">Scottsville</span> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <span class="name">Dollie</span> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <span class="name">Dollie</span> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)

            lot. <span class="name">Dolly</span> went to put <span class="name">Joe</span>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <span class="name">Jess</span> says <span class="name">Flo</span> is the only good looking girl in <span class="place">Illinois</span>. <span class="name">Mr. Essex</span>, the best looking man. Kentucky is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <span class="name">Jess</span> says <span class="quote"><em>"Dollie is - is - is, all right."</em></span> <span class="quote"><em>"She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</em></span><span class="name"> Roy</span>, <span class="name">Nellie</span> and I are <span class="quote"><em>"Smart alecks."</em></span> I went to bed at seven o clock.<span class="weather"><em> It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.</em></span> 
            <h2>February 3rd. Monday.</h2>
            <span class="weather"><em>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing</em></span>. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. <span class="weather"><em>Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</em></span>
            
            <h3>[9] </h3>
            
            Had a very small school, only <span class="cs"><em>eleven</em></span>. Stopped to see <span class="name">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <span class="name">mamma</span> and to the girls. Talked of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger">suicides</a>. <span class="name">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger">suicide</a>.

            <h2>January 30th. Thursday</h2>
            <p> Had good <span class="place">school</span>. <span class="weather">Sunny</span> in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <span class="name" id="name6">Irwin</span> and <span class="name" id="name8">Roy</span> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <span class="name" id="name10">Lou</span> and <span class="name" id="name12">Lillie</span> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <span class="name" id="name14">Lillie</span>'s watch back with mine. – <span class="name" id="name16">Jesse</span> laughs at me about being always hungry. <span class="name" id="name18">Nellie</span> and <span class="name" id="name20">Mary</span> went to <span class="place">church</span>. <span class="name" id="name24">J</span> called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that I would rather be

                a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the <span class="place">school house</span>. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <span class="name" id="name30">Mr. Strate</span>'s. Had music. Laughed at <span class="name" id="name32">Joe</span> and <span class="name" id="name34">Charlie</span> about going to "Hunt"('s) <span class="name" id="name36">Charlie</span> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the <span class="place">creek</span>. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started <span class="place">home</span> it was <span class="weather">raining</span>. <span class="name" id="name44">John Dollie</span> and I came across the pasture. (
        QQQ-element: parentheses<span class="name" id="name1">Dollie</span> thought we were going to China.) <span class="name" id="name48">Joe</span> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <span class="name" id="name50">Peek</span>'s brought <span class="name" id="name52">Mary</span> and <span class="name" id="name54">Nellie</span> <span class="place">home</span>. <span class="name" id="name58">John Whitehouse</span> was converted. (<span class="name" id="name60">John W.</span> came to <span class="place">school</span> this evening for <span class="name" id="name64">Lou</span> and <span class="name" id="name66">Lillie</span>.</p></div>

            <h2>January 31st. Friday.</h2> 
            <p>Dark and <span class="weather">rainy</span>. Had twenty pupils. <span class="name" id="name4">Irwin</span>, <span class="name" id="name6">Walter</span>, <span class="name" id="name8">Charlie</span>, <span class="name" id="name10">Roy</span> + <span class="name" id="name12">John</span> went down the road and came back after school had called. <span class="name" id="name14">Roy</span> and <span class="name" id="name16">John</span> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the <span class="place">bridge</span> I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <span class="name" id="name20">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            <h2>February 1st. Saturday</h2> 
            <p>Dark and <span class="weather">gloomy</span>. Wish I could be at <span class="place">Nilwood</span> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span class="name" id="name6">Nellie</span> about <span class="place">school</span>. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <span class="name" id="name10">Jesse</span> went to <span class="name" id="name12">Modesto</span>. <span class="name" id="name14">Roy</span> cut wood. <span class="name" id="name16">Mary</span> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <span class="name" id="name18">Jess</span> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <span class="name" id="name20">Ed</span> came in the evening. He got letters from <span class="name" id="name22">Mamma</span>, <span class="name" id="name24">Ida</span> and <span class="name" id="name26">Katie M.</span> got school journal and circular from <span class="name" id="name28">supt. McClure</span>.

                told about hauling one Jermin? of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <span class="place">Carlinville</span> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <span class="name" id="name36">Joe</span> came home with <span class="name" id="name38">Jess</span>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <span class="name" id="name40">Dolly</span> got mad. The boys went to <span class="place">town</span>. As they were starting, <span class="name" id="name44">Joe</span> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <span class="name" id="name46">Dolly</span> and I went to church with <span class="name" id="name48">Ed</span>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <span class="name" id="name50">Rhoads</span> preached, but got sick and <span class="name" id="name52">King</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <span class="name" id="name54">Lillie</span> came to tell us about going over

I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <span class="name" id="name9">Roy</span> and I took down items; and <span class="name" id="name11">Joe</span> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the <span class="place">bed room</span>. threw the book to <span class="name" id="name15">Roy</span> but <span class="name" id="name17">Charlie</span> got it. They went in little <span class="place">bed room</span> to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the <span class="place">milk house</span> and read, then gave us the book. <span class="name" id="name23">Mary</span> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

                Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <span class="name" id="name10">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span class="name" id="name12">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

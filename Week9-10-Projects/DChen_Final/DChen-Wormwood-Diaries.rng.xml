                went in the other room and drew map of Italy. Beautiful night, not very cold. Went
                to bed early. I rode home from school, <name>Jennie Dyer</name> and I stood up. </p>

                    role="preacher">King</name> preached about "The light of the world." Three boys
                went forward. I got letter from <name>Miss Riefenberg</name>.</p>

            <p n="1">Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon
                    <name>Irwin</name> and <name>Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest
                monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth.
                    <name>Lou</name> and <name>Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society
                met. – Turned <name>Lillie</name>'s watch back with mine. – <name>Jesse</name>
                laughs at me about being always hungry. <name>Nellie</name> and <name>Mary</name>
                went to church. <dialog type="persuation"><name>J</name> called us "Back woodsers" I
                    replied, that I would rather be <pb n="page70"/> a "backwoodser" than a
                    "heathen".</dialog> We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no
                meeting. Went to <name role="teacher">Mr. Strate</name>'s. Had music. Laughed at
                    <name>Joe</name> and <name>Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s)
                    <name>Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not
                been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all
                "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name>John Dollie</name> and I came
                across the pasture. (Dollie thought we were going to China.) <name>Joe</name> asked
                what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <name>Peek</name>'s brought
                    <name>Mary</name> and <name>Nellie</name> home. <name>John Whitehouse</name> was
                converted. (<name>John W.</name> came to school this evening for <name>Lou</name>
                and <name>Lillie</name>.) </p>

            <date when="1896-01-31">January 31st. Friday.</date>
            <p n="1">Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name>Irwin</name>, <name>Walter</name>,
                    <name>Charlie</name>, <name>Roy</name> + <name>John</name> went down the road
                and came back after school had called. <name>Roy</name> and <name>John</name> tried
                themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger.
                After school I traced pencil marks in register. <dialog type="information-seeking"
                    >As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to
                    cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they
                    just took a notion to be mean." </dialog>A I came across the bridge I sat on the
                banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper.
                    <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he
                brought up "scripture <pb n="page72"/> argument; read two chapters from the
                Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us
                "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <name>Lillie</name> did not come to school.

            <date when="1896-02-01">February 1st. Saturday</date>
            <p n="1">Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local
                Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a
                talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I
                fixed my tan skirt. Jesse went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name>Roy</name> cut wood.
                    <name>Mary</name>baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so
                much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the
                first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got
                letters from Mamma, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M.</name> got school journal
                and circular from <name role="superintendent">supt.McClure</name>. <pb n="page73"/>
                told about hauling one<footnotes>¹</footnotes> of my pupils around in the big wagon.
                Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the
                wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about "Back
                woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys
                went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back
                something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us
                oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were
                very bad, and we went through the fields. <name role="preacher">Rhoads</name>
                preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting.
                Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon
                    <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over <pb n="page74"/> to
                    <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted
                    <name>Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name>
                to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>

            <p n="1"> Rainy and dark. <name>Jess</name> went away. <name>Charie Crawford</name>
                came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen";
                also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <name>Roy</name> and I
                took down items; and <name>Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped
                straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name>Roy</name> but
                    <name>Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would
                not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book.
                    <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the <pb n="page75"
                /> lot.² <name>Dolly</name> went to put <name>Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to
                stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved
                that bake is right. <dialog type="persuation">
                    <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in
                        <place>Illinois</place>. <name role="teacher">Mr. Essex</name>, the best
                    looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big
                    feet. <name>Jess</name> says "Dollie is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart
                    to be called a backwoodser." <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are
                    "Smart alecks."</dialog> I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained,
                sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and
                sleet. </p>

            <date when="1896-02-03">February 3rd. Monday.</date>
            <p n="1"> Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like
                Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed <pb n="page76"/> Had
                a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short
                talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the
                girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is
                out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper
                I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had
                no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.

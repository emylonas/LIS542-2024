            <h2>January 28th.Tuesday.</h2>
            <p>1Got up early. Pretty day, –thawed considerably. Had full school. Good lessons.
                After supper had discussion on "Negro" and "Indian" question. Laughed about
                    <span class="name">Dollie</span> and me goin' (Gowin). <span class="name">Roy</span> ate an onion, and I
                went in the other room and drew map of Italy. Beautiful night, not very cold. Went
                to bed early. I rode home from school, <span class="name">Jennie Dyer</span> and I stood up. </p>

            <h2>January 29th. Wednesday.</h2>
            <p>1Pretty day. Had good school. <span class="name">Lou</span> went home at last recess. They
                laughed about <span class="name">"Scratch"</span> bringing <span class="name">Rose</span> home. A. class drew
                map of Italy, on board. In B. Geog. I asked how high is the highest peak in  [page69] 
                
                the U.S., and had to laugh. We walked to meeting at the Baptist church. <span class="name">King</span> preached about "The light of the world." Three boys
                went forward. I got letter from <span class="name">Miss Riefenberg</span>.</p>

            <h2>January 30th. Thursday</h2>
            <p>1Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon
                    <span class="name">Irwin</span> and <span class="name">Roy</span> tried to see who could act the "biggest
                monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth.
                    <span class="name">Lou</span> and <span class="name">Lillie</span> fixed minutes of last evening Society
                met. – Turned <span class="name">Lillie</span>'s watch back with mine. – <span class="name">Jesse</span>
                laughs at me about being always hungry. <span class="name">Nellie</span> and <span class="name">Mary</span>
                went to church. <span class="name">J</span> called us "Back woodsers" I
                    replied, that I would rather be  [page70]  a "backwoodser" than a
                    "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no
                meeting. Went to <span class="name">Mr. Strate</span>'s. Had music. Laughed at
                    <span class="name">Joe</span> and <span class="name">Charlie</span> about going to "Hunt"('s)
                    <span class="name">Charlie</span> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not
                been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all
                "Young." When we started home it was raining. <span class="name">John Dollie</span> and I came
                across the pasture. (Dollie thought we were going to China.) <span class="name">Joe</span> asked
                what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <span class="name">Peek</span>'s brought
                    <span class="name">Mary</span> and <span class="name">Nellie</span> home. <span class="name">John Whitehouse</span> was
                converted. (<span class="name">John W.</span> came to school this evening for <span class="name">Lou</span>
                and <span class="name">Lillie</span>.) </p>

            <h2>January 31st. Friday.</h2>
            <p>1Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <span class="name">Irwin</span>, <span class="name">Walter</span>,
                    <span class="name">Charlie</span>, <span class="name">Roy</span> + <span class="name">John</span> went down the road
                and came back after school had called. <span class="name">Roy</span> and <span class="name">John</span> tried
                themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger.
                After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to
                    cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they
                    just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the
                banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper.
                    <span class="name">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he
                brought up "scripture  [page72]  argument; read two chapters from the
                Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us
                "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <span class="name">Lillie</span> did not come to school.

            <h2>February 1st. Saturday</h2>
            <p>1Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <span class="place">Nilwood</span> to the Local
                Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a
                talk with <span class="name">Nellie</span> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I
                fixed my tan skirt. Jesse went to <span class="place">Modesto</span>. <span class="name">Roy</span> cut wood.
                    <span class="name">Mary</span>baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so
                much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <span class="name">Jess</span> said it was the
                first time he ever saw me not hungry) <span class="name">Ed</span> came in the evening. He got
                letters from Mamma, <span class="name">Ida</span> and <span class="name">Katie M.</span> got school journal
                and circular from <span class="name">supt.McClure</span>.  [page73] 
                told about hauling one¹ of my pupils around in the big wagon.
                Laughed about him going to <span class="place">Carlinville</span> on Tues., following the
                wagon-ride. <span class="name">Joe</span> came home with <span class="name">Jess</span>. Argued about "Back
                woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <span class="name">Dolly</span> got mad. The boys
                went to town. As they were starting, <span class="name">Joe</span> was going to make me take back
                something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us
                oranges. <span class="name">Dolly</span> and I went to church with <span class="name">Ed</span>. Roads were
                very bad, and we went through the fields. <span class="name">Rhoads</span>
                preached, but got sick and <span class="name">King</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting.
                Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon
                    <span class="name">Lillie</span> came to tell us about going over  [page74]  to
                    <span class="place">Scottsville</span> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted
                    <span class="name">Dollie</span> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <span class="name">Dollie</span>
                to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>

            <h2>February 2nd. Sunday.</h2>
            <p>1 Rainy and dark. <span class="name">Jess</span> went away. <span class="name">Charie Crawford</span>
                came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen";
                also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <span class="name">Roy</span> and I
                took down items; and <span class="name">Joe</span> started for the book, I screamed, jumped
                straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <span class="name">Roy</span> but
                    <span class="name">Charlie</span> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would
                not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book.
                    <span class="name">Mary</span> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the  [page75]  lot.² <span class="name">Dolly</span> went to put <span class="name">Joe</span>'s hat on him and had to
                stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved
                that bake is right. 
                    <span class="name">Jess</span> says <span class="name">Flo</span> is the only good looking girl in
                        <span class="place">Illinois</span>. <span class="name">Mr. Essex</span>, the best
                    looking man. <span class="place">Kentucky</span> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big
                    feet. <span class="name">Jess</span> says "Dollie is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart
                    to be called a backwoodser." <span class="name">Roy</span>, <span class="name">Nellie</span> and I are
                    "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained,
                sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and
                sleet. </p>

            <h2>February 3rd. Monday.</h2>
            <p>1 Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like
                Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed  [page76]  Had
                a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <span class="name">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short
                talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the
                girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is
                out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper
                I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span class="name">Jess</span> said he had
                no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.

# About

This folder contains the necessary files to build out an HTML publication using excerpts from the Wormwood Diary, written by Emma Wormwood from 1895 to 1898. The digitized pages and crowdsourced XML transcription can be found on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/mms_221/page/n67/mode/1up). 

# Rationale and Encoding Guideline

In addition to existing metadata and format elements, new elements (listed below), were added. It is important to note that the elements were added with a particular audience in mind. Namely, scholars who are interested in examining the types of dialogs that were recorded for close-reading analysis and other scholarly purposes.

`element name="dialog"` is added so scholars can note dialog instances and identify their types. The types of dialog are indicated in DChen-Wormwood-Diaries.rng as well as in the section below. They are adapted from Douglas Walton's "Burden of Proof in Deliberation Dialogs." 

<!--This is just one of the first few searches that came up when I tried to find dialog types.-->

|Type of Dialog|Situation|Goal|
|----|----|----|
|Persuation|Conflict of Opinions|Persuade Other Party|
|Inquiry|Need to Have Proof|Find and Verify Evidence|
|Discovery|Need to Find an Explanation of Facts|Find and Defend a Suitable Hypothesis|
|Negotiation|Conflict of Interests|Get What You Most Want|
|Information-Seeking|Need Information|Acquire or Give Information|
|Deliberation|Dilemma or Practical Choice|Co-ordinate Goal and Actions|
|Eristic|Personal Conflict|Verbally Hit Out at Opponent|

`element name="footnote"` is added to ensure an accurate representation of the digitized text will not be compromised for the temporary technical difficulties.

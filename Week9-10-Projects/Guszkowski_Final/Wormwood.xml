(<name>Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place type="country">China</place>.) <name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <name>Peek</name>'s brought <name>Mary</name> and <name>Nellie</name> home. <name>John Whitehouse</name> was converted.

                Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <name>Irwin</name>, <name>Walter</name>, <name>Charlie</name>, <name>Roy</name> + <name>John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name>Roy</name> and <name>John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote qtype="dialogue">"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <place type="city">Modesto</place> paper. <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up <quote qtype="terminology">"scripture"</quote>

            argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us <quote qtype="dialogue">"backwoodsers."</quote> We went to bed early. <name>Lillie</name> did not come to school.

          Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place type="city">Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to <place type="city">Modesto</place>. <name>Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name>Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from <name>Mamma</name>, <name>Ida</name> and <name>Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from supt. <name>McClure</name>.

            
            told about hauling one <margin-note><name>Jermin</name></margin-note> of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place type="city">Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jess</name>. Argued about <quote qtype="terminology">"Back woodsers"</quote> and <quote qtype="terminology">"Mountain heathens"</quote>. They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name>Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name>Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name>Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name>Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over

            to <place type="city">Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name>Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name>Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)

               Rainy and dark. <name>Jess</name> went away. <name>Charie Crawford</name> came. I read story of <quote qtype="title">"Howard and his Teacher"</quote>. Laughed about <quote qtype="title">"Love in the Kitchen"</quote>; also <quote qtype="title">"Love in the Front-room."</quote> (<quote qtype="dialogue">"I'd get it and keep it"</quote>.) <name>Roy</name> and I took down items; and <name>Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name>Roy</name> but <name>Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            lot. <name>Dolly</name> went to put <name>Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jess</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place type="state">Illinois</place>. <name>Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place type="state">Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jess</name> says <quote qtype="dialogue"><name>"Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right."</quote> <quote qtype="dialogue">"She's too smart to be called a backwoodser."</quote> <name>Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are <quote qtype="dialogue">"Smart alecks."</quote> I went to bed at seven o clock.

            Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. <quote qtype="dialogue">(If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.)</quote> I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.

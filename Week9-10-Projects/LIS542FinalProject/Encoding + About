About This Project

This project aims to create a simple HTML publication of the Emma Woodward Diary using XML, Relax NG, XSLT, and CSS. The goal is to model the diary accurately with descriptive markup and provide a web-based view of the content.

The XML encoding captures key features of the diary, including names, places, quotes, and editorial notes. Attributes provide additional context, such as standardized names and weather descriptions. The Relax NG schema ensures the structure and content are validated, while Schematron rules enforce specific encoding practices.

The XSLT transforms the XML into a readable HTML format, and CSS styles the HTML to highlight different elements.

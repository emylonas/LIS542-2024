         <p>Got up early. Pretty day, –thawed considerably. Had full school. Good lessons. After
            supper had discussion on "Negro" and "Indian" question. Laughed about Dollie and me
            goin' (Gowin). Roy ate an onion, and I went in the other room and drew map of Italy.
            Beautiful night, not very cold. Went to bed early. I rode home from school, Jennie
            Dyer and I stood up.</p>
         <p><span class="date">January 29th. Wednesday.</span></p>
         <p>Pretty day. Had good school. Lou went home at last recess. They laughed about "Scratch"
            bringing Rose home. A. class drew map of Italy, on board. In B. Geog. I asked how
            high is the highest peak in</p>
         <p><span class="date">January 30th. Thursday</span></p>
         <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon Irwin and Roy
            tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped
            rope (buggy line) and so-forth. Lou and Lillie fixed minutes of last evening Society
            met. – Turned Lillie's watch back with mine. – Jesse laughs at me about being always
            hungry. Nellie and Mary went to church. J called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that
            I would rather be</p>
         <p>a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there;
            had no meeting. Went to Mr. Strate's. Had music. Laughed at Joe and Charlie about
            going to "Hunt"('s) Charlie has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's
            not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all
            "Young." When we started home it was raining. John Dollie and I came across the pasture.
            (Dollie thought we were going to China.) Joe asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians.
            Peek's brought Mary and Nellie home. John Whitehouse was converted. (John W. came
            to school this evening for Lou and Lillie.)</p>

         <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. Irwin, Walter, Charlie, Roy + John went down the
            road and came back after school had called. Roy and John tried themselves. – I was
            doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced
            pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done
            the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not
            a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." As I came across the bridge I sat on
            the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper.
            Jesse tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>
         <p>argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his
            explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. Lillie did not come to
            school.</p>

         <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened
            up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with Nellie about school.
            (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. Jesse went to Modesto. Roy
            cut wood. Mary baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much
            dinner that I was not hungry for supper. Jess said it was the first time he ever saw
            me not hungry.) Ed came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, Ida and Katie M.
            got school journal and circular from supt. McClure.</p>
         <p>told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above  -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils around
            in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to Carlinville on Tues., following the wagon-ride.
            Joe came home with Jess. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They
            said Dolly got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, Joe was going to
            make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden
            leave. Gave us oranges. Dolly and I went to church with Ed. Roads were very bad, and
            we went through the fields. Rhoads preached, but got sick and King took the meeting.
            Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon
            Lillie came to tell us about going over</p>
         <p>to Scottsville to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted Dollie to take her part in the dialogue.
            Asked Dollie to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>

         <p>Rainy and dark. Jess went away. Charie Crawford came. I read story of "Howard and
            his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room."
            ("I'd get it and keep it".) Roy and I took down items; and Joe started for the book,
            I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to Roy but
            Charlie got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone:
            they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. Mary called on everybody
            to help put the hogs in the</p>
         <p>lot. Dolly went to put Joe's hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute
            as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. Jess says
            Flo is the only good looking girl in Illinois. Mr. Essex, the best looking man. Kentucky
            is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. Jess says "Dollie is - is - is, all
            right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." Roy, Nellie and I are "Smart
            alecks." I went to bed at seven o'clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not,
            all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.</p>

         <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas
            trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>
         <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. Strate. Made short talk about
            conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting
            locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you
            a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma
            and to the girls. Talked of suicides. Jess said he had no sympathy for such people.
            Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

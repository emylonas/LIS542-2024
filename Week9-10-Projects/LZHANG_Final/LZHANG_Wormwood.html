            Got up early. Pretty day, – thawed considerably. Had full school. Good lessons.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            After supper had a discussion on the <span class="theme">"Negro" and "Indian" question</span>. Laughed about Dollie and me going (Gowin).
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Roy ate an onion, and I went in the other room and drew a <span class="theme">map of Italy</span>. Beautiful night, not very cold. Went to bed early. I rode home from school with
            <span class="person">Jennie Dyer (friend)</span>.

            Pretty day. Had good school. <span class="person">Lou (student)</span> went home at last recess.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            They laughed about <span class="quote">"Scratch bringing Rose home."</span> A class drew a map of Italy, on board. In B. Geography, I asked, <span class="quote">"How high is the highest peak in...?"</span>

            Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. 
            </p>
         <p>
            
            At noon Irwin and Roy tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse,
            rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Lou and Lillie fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned Lillie's watch
            back with mine.

            Jesse laughs at me about being always hungry. Nellie and Mary went to church.

            I replied, that I would rather be a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". 
            </p>
         <p>
            
            We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Went to Mr. Strate's. Had music. Laughed at Joe and Charlie about going to "Hunt"('s)
            Charlie has concluded he would rather hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen
            going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young."
            </p>
         <p>
            
            When we started home it was raining. John, Dollie, and I came across the pasture.
            (Dollie thought we were going to China.)
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Joe asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. Peek's brought Mary and Nellie
            home. John Whitehouse was converted. (John W. came to school this evening for Lou
            and Lillie.)

            <span class="date">January 31st. Friday.</span>
            Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils.
            </p>
         <p>
            Irwin, Walter, Charlie, Roy, and John went down the road and came back after school
            had called. Roy and John tried themselves.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school,
            I traced pencil marks in register.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause
            such actions as had transpired. The reply was, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took
            a notion to be mean."
            </p>
         <p>
            
            As I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over
            the rocks. I read the Modesto paper.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Jesse tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper, he brought up "scripture"

            argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his
            explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. Lillie did not come to
            school.
            </p>
         <p>
            <span class="date">February 1st. Saturday</span>
            Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened
            up books and papers, put most of them in my valise.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Had a talk with Nellie about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my
            tan skirt. Jesse went to Modesto. Roy cut wood. Mary baked all morning.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for
            supper. Jess said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry)
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Ed came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, Ida and Katie M. got school journal
            and circular from supt. McClure.

            told about hauling one <span class="note">(note in parentheses above -- Jermin?)</span> of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to Carlinville on Tuesday,
            following the wagon-ride.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Joe came home with Jess. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They
            said Dolly got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, Joe was going to
            make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden
            leave.
            </p>
         <p>
            
            Gave us oranges. Dolly and I went to church with Ed. Roads were very bad, and we went
            through the fields.

            <span class="person">Rhoads (preacher)</span> preached, but got sick and <span class="person">King (preacher)</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went
            to bed.

            to Scottsville to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <span class="person">Dollie (friend)</span> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked Dollie to bring her books. (Rocking chair

            Rainy and dark. <span class="person">Jess (friend)</span> went away. <span class="person">Charie Crawford (visitor)</span> came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher".

            Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and

            baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <span class="person">Jess (friend)</span> says <span class="person">Flo (acquaintance)</span> is the only good looking girl in Illinois. <span class="person">Mr. Essex (acquaintance)</span>, the best looking man. Kentucky is noted for tobacco, whiskey, and big feet. Jess

            Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas

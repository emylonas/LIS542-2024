            <h2>January 28th. Tuesday.</h2>
            <p>Got up early. Pretty day, –thawed considerably. Had full school. Good lessons. After supper had discussion on "Negro" and "Indian" question. Laughed about <span style="color: red;">Dollie</span> and me goin' (Gowin). <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span> ate an onion, and I went in the other room and drew map of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pfEEVFwBh6wxdVk99">Italy</a>. Beautiful night, not very cold. Went to bed early. I rode home from school, <span style="color: red;">Jennie Dyer</span> and I stood up.</p>
            
            <h2>January 29th. Wednesday.</h2>
            <p>Pretty day. Had good school. <span style="color: yellow;">Lou</span> went home at last recess. They laughed about <span style="color: yellow;">"Scratch"</span> bringing <span style="color: red;">Rose</span> home. A. class drew map of <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/pfEEVFwBh6wxdVk99">Italy</a>, on board. In B. Geog. I asked how high is the highest peak in</p>

            <h2>January 30th. Thursday</h2> 
            <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <span style="color: blue;">Irwin</span> and <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <span style="color: yellow;">Lou</span> and <span style="color: red;">Lillie</span> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <span style="color: red;">Lillie's</span> watch back with mine. – <span style="color: yellow;">Jesse</span> laughs at me about being always hungry. <span style="color: red;">Nellie</span> and Mary went to church. <span style="color: yellow;">J</span> called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that I would rather be</p>
            
             [p003] 
            
            <p>a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <span style="color: blue;">Mr. Strate's.</span> Had music. Laughed at <span style="color: blue;">Joe</span> and <span style="color: blue;">Charlie</span> about going to <span style="color: blue;">"Hunt"('s)</span> <span style="color: blue;">Charlie</span> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <span style="color: blue;">John Dollie</span> and I came across the pasture. (<span style="color: red;">Dollie</span> thought we were going to China.) <span style="color: blue;">Joe</span> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <span style="color: yellow;">Peek's</span> brought <span style="color: red;">Mary</span> and <span style="color: red;">Nellie</span> home. <span style="color: blue;">John Whitehouse</span> was converted. (<span style="color: blue;">John W.</span> came to school this evening for <span style="color: yellow;">Lou</span> and <span style="color: red;">Lillie.</span></p>

            <h2>January 31st. Friday.</h2>
            <p>Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <span style="color: blue;">Irwin</span>, <span style="color: blue;">Walter</span>, <span style="color: blue;">Charlie</span>, <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span> + <span style="color: blue;">John</span> went down the road and came back after school had called. <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span> and <span style="color: blue;">John</span> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CLXG6hGkzAB4cvTV7">Modesto</a> paper. <span style="color: blue;">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>
            
             [p005] 
            
            <p>argument; read two chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early.<span style="color: red;">Lillie</span> did not come to school.</p>
            <h2>February 1st. Saturday</h2>
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/gcP7YANXPtHRSGao7">Nilwood</a> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span style="color: red;">Nellie</span> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <span style="color: blue;">Jesse</span> went to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/CLXG6hGkzAB4cvTV7">Modesto</a>. <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span> cut wood. <span style="color: red;">Mary</span> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <span style="color: blue;">Jess</span> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <span style="color: blue;">Ed</span> came in the evening. He got letters from <span style="color: red;">Mamma</span>, <span style="color: red;">Ida</span> and <span style="color: red;">Katie M.</span> got school journal and circular from supt. <span style="color: yellow;">McClure</span>.

             [p006] 
            
            <p>told about hauling one <span class="modern">Jermin?</span> of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/5fmyfc5Qz44h791u9">Carlinville</a> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <span style="color: blue;">Joe</span> came home with <span style="color: blue;">Jess</span>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <span style="color: red;">Dolly</span> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <span style="color: blue;">Joe</span> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <span style="color: red;">Dolly</span> and I went to church with <span style="color: blue;">Ed</span>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <span style="color: yellow;">Rhoads</span> preached, but got sick and <span style="color: yellow;">King</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <span style="color: red;">Lillie</span> came to tell us about going over</p>
            
             [p007] 
            
            <p>to <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/aYYiKiUz75yYv2Ba8">Scottsville</a> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <span style="color: red;">Dollie</span> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <span style="color: red;">Dollie</span> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p> 
           <h2> February 2nd. Sunday.</h2>
            <p>Rainy and dark. <span style="color: blue;">Jess</span> went away. <span style="color: blue;">Charie Crawford</span> came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span> and I took down items; and <span style="color: blue;">Joe</span> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span> but <span style="color: blue;">Charlie</span> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <span style="color: red;">Mary</span> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the</p>

            <p>lot. <span style="color: red;">Dolly</span> went to put <span style="color: blue;">Joe's</span> hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <span style="color: blue;">Jess</span> says <span style="color: red;">Flo</span> is the only good looking girl in <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/tq7aMtkn8eVTQq5G9">Illinois</a>. <span style="color: blue;">Mr. Essex</span>, the best looking man. <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/7A2FKeJY68UwAh8C7">Kentucky</a> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <span style="color: blue;">Jess</span> says "<span style="color: red;">Dollie</span> is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." <span style="color: blue;">Roy</span>, <span style="color: red;">Nellie</span> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.</p> 
            <h2>February 3rd.    Monday.</h2>
            <p>Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed</p>
            
             [p009] 
            
            <p>Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <span style="color: blue;">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span style="color: blue;">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

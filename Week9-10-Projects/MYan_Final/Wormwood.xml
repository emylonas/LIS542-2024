At noon <name role="student">Irwin</name> and <name role="student">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name role="student">Lou</name> and <name role="student">Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <name role="student">Lillie</name>'s watch back with mine. – <name>Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name>Nellie</name> and <name>Mary</name> went to church.

            a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to Mr. Strate's. Had music. Laughed at <name>Joe</name> and <name role="student">Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name role="student">Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name>John</name> <name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture. (<name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> thought we were going to <place>China</place>.) <name>Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians.

After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote>"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name>Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            argument; read two chapters from the <work>Testament</work>, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <name role="student">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p>
            
            <date when="1895-02-01">February 1st. Saturday</date>
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name>Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name>Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name role="student">Roy</name> cut wood. <name>Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name>Jesse</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) Ed came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, Ida and Katie M. got school journal and circular from supt. McClure.

            told about hauling one <margintext position="above">Jermin?</margintext> of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name>Joe</name> came home with <name>Jesse</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name role="acquaintance">Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name>Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name role="acquaintance">Dolly</name> and I went to church with Ed. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. Rhoads preached, but got sick and King took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name role="student">Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over

            to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p>

            <p> Rainy and dark. <name>Jesse</name> went away. Charie Crawford came. I read story of <work>"Howard and his Teacher"</work>. Laughed about <work>"Love in the Kitchen"</work>; also <work>"Love in the Front-room."</work> ("I'd get it and keep it".) <name role="student">Roy</name> and I took down items; and <name>Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name role="student">Roy</name> but <name role="student">Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name>Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            lot. <name role="acquaintance">Dolly</name> went to put <name>Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name>Jesse</name> says <name>Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. Mr. Essex, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name>Jesse</name> says "<name role="acquaintance">Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." <name role="student">Roy</name>, <name>Nellie</name> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.</p>

            Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. Strate. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. <quote><cite>(If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.)</cite></quote> I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jesse</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

            Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon Irwin and Roy tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. Lou and Lillie fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned Lillie's watch back with mine. – <offense-event belligerents="Jesse, Emma" offenseType="Laughing at" severity="Trivial"><offending-action offender="Jesse" offended="Emma" provoked="False"><laugh-at laughee="Emma" laugher="Jesse" reason="Emma is always hungry">Jesse laughs at me about being always hungry</laugh-at></offending-action></offense-event>.

When we started home it was raining. John Dollie and I came across the pasture. (Dollie thought we were going to China.) Joe asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. Peek's brought Mary and Nellie home. John Whitehouse was converted. (John W. came to school this evening for Lou and Lillie.

Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. Jesse tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with Nellie about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. Jesse went to Modesto. Roy cut wood. Mary baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. Jess said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) Ed came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, Ida and Katie M. got school journal and circular from supt. McClure.
            
            
            
            told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above  -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to Carlinville on Tues., following the wagon-ride. Joe came home with Jess. <offense-event belligerents="Dolly, Emma, Joe, Jesse" offenseType="Name Calling" severity="Moderate"><offending-action offender="Joe, Jesse" offended="Emma, Dolly" provoked="False">Argued</offending-action> about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens".

Gave us oranges. Dolly and I went to church with Ed. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. Rhoads preached, but got sick and King took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon Lillie came to tell us about going over
            
            
            
            to Scottsville to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted Dollie to take her part in the dialogue. Asked Dollie to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)

            Rainy and dark. Jess went away. Charie Crawford came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) Roy and I took down items; and Joe started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to Roy but Charlie got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. Mary called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            lot. Dolly went to put Joe's hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. Jess says Flo is the only good looking girl in Illinois. Mr. Essex, the best looking man. Kentucky is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. Jess says "Dollie is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." Roy, Nellie and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.

            Two or three inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed
            
            
            
            Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. Strate. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. Jess said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.

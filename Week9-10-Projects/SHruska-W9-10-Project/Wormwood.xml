            Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name>Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name>Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

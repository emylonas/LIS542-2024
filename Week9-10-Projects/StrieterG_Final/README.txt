XML Edits

Added place as it is relevant to setting.
Added time as it is relevant to setting and narrative.

Created “list” element to encompass instance of a A. _______ then B.______ list written in text. 

Schema Edits
Encoded all new elements into the schema

Schematron Edits
Encoded Schematron with rules for best practice, indicating the importance of string length in date/when and that pb element’s n attribute starts with “p” to indicate the page number being broken.

XSL Edits
Encoded XSL file to define new elements: weather and time. Added defining notes for “quote” element as well. All done to make defining and creating CSS easier. I chose not to define the new “list” element as it only appears once and would not create a pattern or, I believed, generate enough interest to warrant its own definition.

CSS Edits
Color coordinated several elements within CSS to highlight selected elements within the HTML format.

Laughed about <span class="name">Dollie</span> and me goin' (Gowin). <span class="name">Roy</span> ate an onion, and I went in the other room and drew map of Italy. Beautiful night, not very cold. Went to bed early. I rode home from school, <span class="name">Jennie Dyer</span> and I stood up. </p>

            Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <span class="name">Irwin</span> and <span class="name">Roy</span> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <span class="name">Lou</span> and <span class="name">Lillie</span> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned Lillie's watch back with mine. – <span class="name">Jesse</span> laughs at me about being always hungry. <span class="name">Nellie</span> and <span class="name">Mary</span> went to church.

Laughed at Joe and Charlie about going to "Hunt"('s) Charlie has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. John Dollie and I came across the pasture. (Dollie thought we were going to China.) Joe asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. Peek's brought Mary and Nellie home. <span class="name">John Whitehouse</span> was converted. (John W. came to school this evening for Lou and Lillie.</p>

Roy and John tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <span class="place">Modesto</span> paper. Jesse tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture</p>

            Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <span class="place">Nilwood</span> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with Nellie about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. Jesse went to <span class="place">Modesto</span>. Roy cut wood. Mary baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. Jess said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <span class="name">Ed</span> came in the evening. He got letters from <span class="name">Mamma</span>, <span class="name">Ida</span> and <span class="name">Katie M.</span> got school journal and circular from <span class="name">supt.

Laughed about him going to <span class="place">Carlinville</span> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. Joe came home with Jess. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said Dolly got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, Joe was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. Dolly and I went to church with Ed. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <span class="name">Rhoads</span> preached, but got sick and <span class="name">King</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon Lillie came to tell us about going over</p>

                Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) Roy and I took down items; and Joe started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to Roy but Charlie got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book.

Jess says Flo is the only good looking girl in Illinois. <span class="name">Mr. Essex</span>, the best looking man. Kentucky is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. Jess says "Dollie is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." Roy, Nellie and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at seven o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet.</p>

            Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <span class="name">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. Jess said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

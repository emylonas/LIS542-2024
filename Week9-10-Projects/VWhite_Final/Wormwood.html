(Dollie thought we were going to <span class="place">China</span>.) <span style="color: green;">Joe</span> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians.

After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <q>Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean.</q> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <span style="color: green;">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <span class="place">Nilwood</span> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span style="color: green;">Nellie</span> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <span style="color: green;">Jesse</span> went to <span class="place">Modesto</span>. <span style="color: green;">Roy</span> cut wood. <span style="color: green;">Mary</span> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <span style="color: green;">Jess</span> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) Ed came in the evening. He got letters from <span style="color: green;">Mamma</span>, <span style="color: green;">Ida</span> and <span style="color: green;">Katie M.</span> got school journal and circular from supt.

Argued about <q>Back woodsers</q> and <q>Mountain heathens</q>. They said <span style="">Dolly</span> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <span style="color: green;">Joe</span> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <span style="">Dolly</span> and I went to church with <span style="color: blue;">Ed</span>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <span style="">Rhoads</span> preached, but got sick and <span style="">King</span> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven.

                Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <span style="">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <span style="">mamma</span> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span style="color: green;">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

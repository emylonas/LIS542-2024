            <p>Dark and rainy.

After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, <quote qtype= "dialogue">Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean.</quote> A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name role= "student">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place type="city">Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name role= "student">Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name role= "student">Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name role= "student">Roy</name> cut wood. <name role= "student">Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name role= "student">Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) Ed came in the evening. He got letters from <name role= "student">Mamma</name>, <name role= "student">Ida</name> and <name role= "student">Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from supt. McClure.

                told about hauling one ([[note in parentheses above  -- Jermin?]]) of my pupils around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place type= "city">Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name role= "student">Joe</name> came home with Jess. Argued about <quote qtype="dialogue">Back woodsers</quote> and <quote qtype="dialogue">Mountain heathens</quote>. They said <name>Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name role= "student">Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name role= "frienf">Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name role= "friend">Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name>Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name>King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name role= "friend">Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over

                Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <name role="townsperson">Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to <name role="mother">mamma</name> and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name role= "student">Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

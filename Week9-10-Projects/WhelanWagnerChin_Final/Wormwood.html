At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span class="name">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

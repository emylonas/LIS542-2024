            went down the road and came back after school had called. <span class="name">Roy</span> and <span class="name">John</span> 
            tried themselves. – I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil 
            marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had
            transpired. The reply, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean."</span> As I
            came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the <span style="color: purple;">Modesto</span> 
            paper. <span class="name">Jesse</span> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">backwoodsers</span>." We went to bed early. <span class="name">Lillie</span> did not come to school. </p></div>

            Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span class="name">Nellie</span> 
            about school. a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <span class="name">Jesse</span> went to <span style="color: purple;">Modesto</span>. 
            <span class="name">Roy</span> cut wood. <span class="name">Mary</span> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate 
            so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <span class="name">Jess</span> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) 
            <span class="name">Ed</span> came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, <span class="name">Ida</span> and <span class="name">Katie</span> M. got school

            (Jermine)<br/><br/> told about hauling one of my pupils around 
            in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <span style="color: purple;">Carlinville</span> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. 
            <span class="name">Joe</span> came home with <span class="name">Jess</span>. Argued about "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Back woodsers</span>" and
            "<span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;">Mountain heathens</span>". They said <span class="name">Dolly</span> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were
            starting, <span class="name">Joe</span> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. 
            Gave us oranges. <span class="name">Dolly</span> and I went to church with <span class="name">Ed</span>. Roads were very bad, and we went through 
            the fields. <span class="name">Rhoads</span> preached, but got sick and <span class="name">King</span> took the meeting. 
            Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <span class="name">Lillie</span> came 
                to tell us about going over

            to <span style="color: purple;">Scottsville</span> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <span class="name">Dollie</span> to take her part in the dialogue.
            Asked <span class="name">Dollie</span> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold two)</p></div>

            I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." 
            ("I'd get it and keep it".) <span class="name">Roy</span> and I took down items; and <span class="name">Joe</span> started 
            for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <span class="name">Roy</span> 
            but <span class="name">Charlie</span> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went 
            out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <span class="name">Mary</span> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see <span class="name">Mr. Strate</span>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, 
            but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were <a href="https://blog.nationalarchives.gov.uk/lock-love/">getting locks of 
            everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.)</a> I was tired all day: about sick.
            After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <span class="name">Jess</span> said he had no sympathy for such people. 
            Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide. </p></div>

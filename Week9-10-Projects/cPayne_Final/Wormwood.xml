            <date when="1896-01-30">January 30th. Thursday</date> 
            <p>Had good school. Sunny in the morning – clouded in afternoon. At noon <name xml:id="irwin001">Irwin</name> and <name xml:id="roy001">Roy</name> tried to see who could act the "biggest monkey." Rode horse, rubbed him down, jumped rope (buggy line) and so-forth. <name xml:id="lou001">Lou</name> and <name xml:id="lillie001">Lillie</name> fixed minutes of last evening Society met. – Turned <name xml:id="lillie001">Lillie</name>'s watch back with mine. – <name xml:id="jesse001">Jesse</name> laughs at me about being always hungry. <name xml:id="nellie001">Nellie</name> and <name xml:id="mary001">Mary</name> went to church. <name xml:id="j001">J</name> called us "Back woodsers" I replied, that I would rather be
            
            <pb n="page03"/>
            
            a "backwoodser" than a "heathen". We went down to the school house. Not many there; had no meeting. Went to <name xml:id="strate001">Mr. Strate</name>'s. Had music. Laughed at <name xml:id="joe001">Joe</name> and <name xml:id="charlie001">Charlie</name> about going to "Hunt"('s) <name xml:id="charlie001">Charlie</name> has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. <name xml:id="john001">John</name> <name xml:id="dollie001">Dollie</name> and I came across the pasture. (<name xml:id="dollie001">Dollie</name> thought we were going to China.) <name xml:id="joe001">Joe</name> asked what I had been saying about Kentuckians. <name xml:id="peek001">Peek</name>'s brought <name xml:id="mary001">Mary</name> and <name xml:id="nellie001">Nellie</name> home. <name xml:id="john001">John Whitehouse</name> was converted.

            <p>Dark and rainy. Had <number value="20" type="quantity">twenty</number> pupils. <name xml:id="irwin001">Irwin</name>, <name xml:id="walter001">Walter</name>, <name xml:id="charlie001">Charlie</name>, <name xml:id="roy001">Roy</name> + <name xml:id="john001">John</name> went down the road and came back after school had called. <name xml:id="roy001">Roy</name> and <name xml:id="john001">John</name> tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. <name xml:id="jesse001">Jesse</name> tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up scripture
            
            <pb n="page05"/>
            
            argument; read <number value="2" type="quantity">two</number> chapters from the Testament, asked our opinions, then gave us his explanation. Calls us "backwoodsers." We went to bed early. <name xml:id="lillie001">Lillie</name> did not come to school.</p>
            <date when="1896-02-01">February 1st. Saturday</date>
            <p>Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at <place>Nilwood</place> to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <name xml:id="nellie001">Nellie</name> about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. <name xml:id="jesse001">Jesse</name> went to <place>Modesto</place>. <name xml:id="roy001">Roy</name> cut wood. <name xml:id="mary001">Mary</name> baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. <name xml:id="jesse001">Jess</name> said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) <name xml:id="ed001">Ed</name> came in the evening. He got letters from Mamma, <name xml:id="ida001">Ida</name> and <name xml:id="katie001">Katie M.</name> got school journal and circular from <name xml:id="mcclure001">supt. McClure</name>.

            told about hauling <number type="quantity" value="1">one</number> of my pupils <marginalia>(<name xml:id="jermin001">Jermin</name>)</marginalia> around in the big wagon. Laughed about him going to <place>Carlinville</place> on Tues., following the wagon-ride. <name xml:id="joe001">Joe</name> came home with <name xml:id="jesse001">Jess</name>. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <name xml:id="dollie001">Dolly</name> got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <name xml:id="joe001">Joe</name> was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. <name xml:id="dollie001">Dolly</name> and I went to church with <name xml:id="ed001">Ed</name>. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. <name xml:id="rhoads001">Rhoads</name> preached, but got sick and <name xml:id="king001">King</name> took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon <name xml:id="lillie001">Lillie</name> came to tell us about going over
            
            <pb n="page07"/>
            
            to <place>Scottsville</place> to wait on her sick cousin. Wanted <name xml:id="dollie001">Dollie</name> to take her part in the dialogue. Asked <name xml:id="dollie001">Dollie</name> to bring her books. (Rocking chair proved to hold <number value="2" type="quantity">two</number>)</p> 
            <date when="1896-02-02">February 2nd. Sunday.</date>
            <p>Rainy and dark. <name xml:id="jesse001">Jess</name> went away. <name xml:id="charlie001">Charlie Crawford</name> came. I read story of "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room." ("I'd get it and keep it".) <name xml:id="roy001">Roy</name> and I took down items; and <name xml:id="joe001">Joe</name> started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to <name xml:id="roy001">Roy</name> but <name xml:id="charlie001">Charlie</name> got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the milk house and read, then gave us the book. <name xml:id="mary001">Mary</name> called on everybody to help put the hogs in the

            lot. <name xml:id="dollie001">Dolly</name> went to put <name xml:id="joe001">Joe</name>'s hat on him and had to stand on the bench. Had dispute as to whether pancakes were baked, or fried: proved that bake is right. <name xml:id="jesse001">Jess</name> says <name xml:id="flo001">Flo</name> is the only good looking girl in <place>Illinois</place>. <name xml:id="essex001">Mr. Essex</name>, the best looking man. <place>Kentucky</place> is noted for tobacco, whiskey and and big feet. <name xml:id="jesse001">Jess</name> says "<name xml:id="dollie001">Dollie</name> is - is - is, all right." "She's too smart to be called a backwoodser." <name xml:id="roy001">Roy</name>, <name xml:id="nellie001">Nellie</name> and I are "Smart alecks." I went to bed at <number value="7" type="time">seven</number> o clock. It snowed, rained, sleeted and what not, all day. ground not at all frozen but covered with snow and sleet. </p>
            <date when="1896-02-03">February 3rd. Monday.</date>
            <p><number value="2" type="quantity">Two</number> or <number value="3" type="quantity">three</number> inches of snow and still snowing. Trees and bushes look like Christmas trees. Snowed all day, but thawed more than it snowed
            
            <pb n="page09"/>
            
            Had a very small school, only <number value="11" type="quantity">eleven</number>. Stopped to see <name xml:id="strate001">Mr. Strate</name>. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. <name xml:id="jesse001">Jess</name> said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>

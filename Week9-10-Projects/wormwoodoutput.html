Went to <span class="name"/> Mr. Strate's. Had music. Laughed at <span class="name">Joe and Charlie</span> about going to "Hunt"('s) Charlie has concluded he would rather Hunt than fish, so he's not been lately seen going up the creek. – We suppose it is because the fish are all "Young." When we started home it was raining. John Dollie and I came across the pasture. (Dollie thought we were going to <span class="place"/>China. Joe asked what I had been saying about <span class="identity"> Kentuckians</span>other.

                Dark and rainy. Had twenty pupils. <span class="name">Irwin, Walter, Charlie, Roy + John </span> went down the road and came back after school had called. Roy and John tried themselves. –I was doubly kind, in my actions, but, inwardly, I burned with anger. After school I traced pencil marks in register. As I started, I asked if I had made any missteps, or done the least thing to cause such actions as had transpired. The reply, "Nothing. Not a thing, they just took a notion to be mean." A I came across the bridge I sat on the banister and watched the water flow over the rocks. I read the Modesto paper. Jesse tried to make us believe he could not read. After supper he brought up "scripture

            Dark and gloomy. Wish I could be at Nilwood to the Local Institute. I straightened up books and papers, put most of them in my valise. Had a talk with <span class="name"/>Nellie about school. (a perfect jewel, to be so good.) I fixed my tan skirt. Jesse went to <span class="place"/>Modesto. Roy cut wood. <span class="name"/> Mary baked all morning. (Had baked chicken for dinner, and I ate so much dinner that I was not hungry for supper. Jess said it was the first time he ever saw me not hungry) Ed came in the evening. He got letters from <span class="name">Mamma, Ida and Katie M. </span>got school journal and circular from supt.

Laughed about him going to <span class="place"/> Carlinville on Tues., following the wagon-ride. Joe came home with Jess. Argued about "Back woodsers" and "Mountain heathens". They said <span class="name"/> Dolly got mad. The boys went to town. As they were starting, <span class="name"/> Joe was going to make me take back something; I made a certain remark which caused him to take sudden leave. Gave us oranges. Dolly and I went to <span class="place"/>church with Ed. Roads were very bad, and we went through the fields. Rhoads preached, but got sick and King took the meeting. Excellent meeting. Got home about eleven. Boys came before we went to bed. After noon Lillie came to tell us about going over

                  Rainy and dark. Jess went away. <span class="name">Charie Crawford </span>came. I read story of  "Howard and his Teacher". Laughed about "Love in the Kitchen"; also "Love in the Front-room."  ("I'd get it and keep it".) Roy and I took down items; and Joe started for the book, I screamed, jumped straight up and ran in the bed room. threw the book to Roy but Charlie got it. They went in little bed room to read but we would not let them alone: they went out by the <span class="place"/>milk house and read, then gave us the book.

                 Had a very small school, only eleven. Stopped to see Mr. Strate. Made short talk about conduct of Friday. Better results, but far from perfect. At noon, the girls were getting locks of everybody's hair. (If you'll come over after school is out, I'll give you a lock of my hair.) I was tired all day: about sick. After supper I wrote to mamma and to the girls. Talked of suicides. Jess said he had no sympathy for such people. Would not grieve if his own father committed suicide.</p>
